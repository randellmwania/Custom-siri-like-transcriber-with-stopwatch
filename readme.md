# Siri-like Stopwatch and Transcriber

This project is a web-based application that combines a stopwatch functionality with speech recognition and transcription, inspired by Siri's interface. It features a sleek, minimalist design with a pulsating orb reminiscent of Siri's visual cues.

## Features

- Interactive stopwatch with start, stop, and reset functionality
- Real-time speech recognition and transcription
- Voice command support for controlling the stopwatch
- Text-to-speech feedback for voice commands
- Siri-inspired visual design with a pulsating orb

## Files in the Project

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the application
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the application
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the application logic

## Usage

To use the application, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. The application supports the following voice commands:

- "Start": Starts the stopwatch
- "Stop": Stops the stopwatch
- "Reset": Resets the stopwatch to 00:00:00
- "What's the time": Speaks the current stopwatch time

## Technical Details

- The project uses the Web Speech API for speech recognition and synthesis
- The stopwatch is implemented using JavaScript's `Date.now()` for precise timing
- CSS animations are used to create the pulsating effect on the Siri-like orb

## Browser Compatibility

This application requires a modern web browser with support for the Web Speech API. It has been tested and works well in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
